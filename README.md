# Welcome to my project KNOTWIZARD!

The motivation of this is project is to create
the best friendship bracelet patterns editor.


## Features

Threads and Rows 

- change threads color
- add/drop single or many threads from right side
- add/drop two treads from left side
- add/drop rows from top and bottom

View

App layer

- 4 snapshots
- pattern reflection option
- 2 colors pattern with all threads knoted by knot 2 (left to left ">")

- save with visibale text attributes 
- change background color

Pattern

## Roadmap

- Rotate pattern 90 degrees (horizontaly)

- Implement "Conwaysâ€™s Game Of Life" and ather mathematical functions for pattern creation

- Connect to ML (in a core a pattern is 2d array with 5 posabilities (Base 5))
- Create Plugin or separate app to convert image to pattern (like "handwritten text recognition" Python projects)  
- Create pattern to image Plugin or separate app 
- add posability (buttons) to change all not knoted threads to knot 1, 2, 3  or 4 (espesialy useful for 2 colors patterns)
- add posability (buttons) to reflect design horizontaly, verticaly and 45 degrees
