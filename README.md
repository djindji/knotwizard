## Tech Stack

Python 3.10 and greater
- Tkinter (GUI Framework)
- Pillow (for pattern image creation)


## Run Locally
 **Windows .EXE file**
- Download the latest version from project's release or website https://knotwizard.com 

 **Run python code on all platforms**
- Make sure you have Python installed. Install Python at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/djindji/knotwizard
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd knotwizard
```

Install Tkinter
- Tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, 
and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and 
macOS installs of Python, **BUT not in Ubuntu**. So if it's not included use this command:
```bash
  sudo apt install python3-tk
```
Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the app

```bash
  python main.py 
```
